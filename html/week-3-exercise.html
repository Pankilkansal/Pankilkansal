  /* Open this file in your console to be sure what your code is doing! Remember to
     save your file in VS Code first, then refresh the page in your browser to
     see your changes!

  // 1. The function below is written to print a debug log into the console, but something's gone wrong. Can you spot the syntax error? Be sure to check your console for more details!

  function autumnIsGreat {
    console.log("I love the colour of the fall leaves and the smell in the air.");
  }

  autumnIsGreat();


  // 2. This function isn't printing anything to the console at all. Did we forget something? Add what might be missing so we see the message appear in the console.

  const programmingFun = function() {
    console.log("Programming is fun!");
  }

  // 3. Write a function named thisClass() that logs the message "This class is Programming 1, and I'm learning Javascript" into the console.



  // 4. In the `iLoveAnimals()` function below, edit it to accept a single `animal` argument, then have it log the argument to the console.

  function iLoveAnimals() {
    console.log("I love animals!");
    console.log(`And my favourite animal is...`);
    // Log your favourite animal to the console here
  }


  // 5. Write a function called whatToEat that takes one parameter (food), which alerts the name of the food passed to it. Call your function three times with a different food argument each time.


  // 6. Time to make our own calculator! Write a function that takes two arguments (x,y), multiplies them and returns the result. Now, call the function in a console.log() and have it multiply two numbers together.


  // 7. Write a function called dreamVacation() with two parameters, days and place. The function should console.log the following sentence: `My ideal vacation spot is _____. I would need _____ days to see everything.`. Make sure the blanks are being filled with the appropriate parameter using either concatenation or template literals!
